import { CodePlayground } from "@components/docs/code-playground.tsx";

In the example below, you will see an illustration of the various kinds of containers supported in backroad. More components and containers can be added to a container

<CodePlayground client:only="react" id="stackblitz-starters-yersqk" />

`base` returns a normal container, but it can be used to do out of order renders.

```js
const base = br.base({});
br.write({ body: "This is rendered further in the tree" });
base.write({
  body: "This renders before the other component even though its called later, because base container got initialised beforehand",
});
```
